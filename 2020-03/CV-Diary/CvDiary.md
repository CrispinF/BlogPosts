# CV Diary

So I've been 


### Day 1 (maybe)
Agitated throat and lungs causing light coughing. Onset of post nasal drip draining into lungs.

Actions:
* Defensive actions to avoid inflammation and 
* Chew on Cloves to reduce 
* Drinking tea: Licrocish, and Antiviral Teas
* Lots of (not cold) water.

### Day 2
same - no major change maybe a little more coughing

### Day 3
Coughing gets a more intensive. Seems more aggrevated by inflammation from even the minor coughing. Small fits of coughing mostly in the upper respitory area. Some tightness of breath. Continuing post nasal drip.

### Day 4
Coughing more extensive, but still relatively mild. Thankfully the cough is not deep but very shallow so so far the agitagion is very minor. Diligently trying to minimize aggrevation and cough surpression. What seems to work best for me is chewing on cloves and drinking hot or warm liquids.

Trying to minimize any foods that might increase congestion in any way and eat stuff with fair amount of spicyness. Hot showers a couple times a day to drive out some of the congestion which helps.

Cough is worse in evening with some tightness of breath. Deep breathing and mediatation to loosen up body tightness helps here.

### Day 5 - 
Cough is worse some tightness in breathing with general stuffiness. Small coughing fits come and go.

Sticking to same regime as previous days all of which helps but is becoming less effective.
